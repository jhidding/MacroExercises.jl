# Exercises in macro writing
[![Entangled badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/entangled-Use%20the%20source!-%2300aeff)](https://entangled.github.io/)

These are some exercises in meta-programming in Julia. I made these to make myself familiar with Julia symbolic expressions and macro system. 

## Literate programming
I use a system of literate programming called [Entangled](https://entangled.github.io/). Many of the code blocks you see in this document end up in the actual source code for the modules that I use in the examples.

``` {.julia file=src/MacroExercises.jl}
module MacroExercises

include("Polynomials.jl")

end
```
